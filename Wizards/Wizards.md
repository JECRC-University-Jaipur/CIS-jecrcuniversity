<h1> Online Attendance Management System for Google Meet</h1>
<h3>Description About the Idea:-</h3>
</br>
Due to these harsh conditions of the pandemic, all our classes are shifted online by using google meet. </BR>
For teachers, it's hard and time-consuming to Mark attendance for 60 students at a time. They either call the name of students one by one or told students to type their names in the chat box from there teacher note the attendance to their records roll number wise one by one.
</BR>

So here we have created an online attendance management system that automatically records the attendance of the students attending the class at that particular point in time and saves the attendance data to an excel sheet hence making the attendance an easy and less time-consuming task for teachers.
